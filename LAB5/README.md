# Lab 5
Do the following exercise from the book. Follow the instructions for all assignments (one link up) and any specific additional instructions for each problem. 

Ch. 12, Programming Problems 1, pg. 392

Name the program sortedlist.cpp. Make sure the following requirements are met. 

* Program must compile and run.
* Must use the Sorted List ADT SortedListInterface.h 
* For LinkSortedList pg. 376 has the code for insertSorted. You must complete the implementation.
* Therefore the SortedList is not based on a LinkedList but uses its own implementation of a List.
* Driver program should insert 21 random numbers (1-100) on the sorted list.
* Display the numbers as they are inserted.
* To generate a number from 1-100 use the STL random library (not the rand function).
* Then remove the last number inserted (not always the last number on the list).
* Last of all display the sorted list of 20 numbers.
* No user input for driver program.
