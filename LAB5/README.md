# Lab 5
Do the following exercise from the book. Follow the instructions for all assignments (one link up) and any specific additional instructions for each problem. 

Ch. 12, Programming Problems 1, pg. 392

Name the program sortedlist.cpp. Make sure the following requirements are met. 

* Program must compile and run.
* Must use the Sorted List ADT SortedListInterface.h 
* For LinkSortedList pg. 376 has the code for insertSorted. You must complete the implementation.
* Therefore the SortedList is not based on a LinkedList but uses its own implementation of a List.
* Interlude 4 LinkedList.zip has useful files.

* Driver program should:
    - create a sorted list
    - insert 21 random numbers (1-100) using the STL random library (example Interlude6.cpp ).
    - Display the numbers as they are inserted.
    - Then remove the first number inserted.
    - Last of all display the sorted list of 20 numbers.
* No user input for driver program.

Remember to upload all files before submitting.

* sortedlist.cpp
