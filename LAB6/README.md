Ch. 16, Programming Problems 2, pg. 513

Name the program sortedtree.cpp. Make sure the following requirements are met. 

* Program must compile and run.
* Driver program should:
    - insert 21 random numbers (1-100) on the binary search tree using the STL random library
    - remove the first number inserted
    - and display the tree
* To display just use in order traversal
* No user input for driver program.
* Inherit from binarytree (binarytree.zip) as a starting point.
* Use the BST ADT BinarySearchTree.h
* First hint: remove override keywords when copying the prototypes from the .h file.
* Second hint: use this->rootPtr to acess rootPtr in BinaryNodeTree from BinarySearchTree.

Remember to upload all files before submitting.
