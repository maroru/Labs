# Lab 4 : Santa's Gift List

Ch. 8 Programming Problems 2, pg. 264

2. Santa Claus allegedly keeps lists of those who are naughty and those who are nice. On the naughty list are the names of those who will get coal in their stockings. On the nice list are those who will receive gifts. Each object in this list contains a name (a string) and a list of that person's gifts (an instance of an ADT list). Design an ADT for the objects in the nice list. Specify each ADT operation by stating its purpose, describing its parameters, and writing preconditions, postconditions, and a pseudocode version of its header. Then write a template interface for the ADT that includes javadoc-style comments.

Name the progam giftlist.cpp. Make sure the following requirements are met.
* Program must compile and run.
* All inputs are strings (may have spaces).
* Only do the nice list, not the naughty list.
* User will enter names until empty string denoting no more names.
* Each name will be followed by one or more gifts.
* After names entered display contents of the name list and each gift list.
* A single string list is not an adequate data structure. Nor are parallel arrays, instead create an object oriented design.
